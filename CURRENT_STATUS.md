# CURRENT_STATUS — clubOrchestra-lab

**Updated:** 2026-10-04 · **Task:** CO-P1-001 · **Phase:** P1 (control plane, simulated workers)
Tags: PLANNED / IMPLEMENTED / TESTED / E2E_VERIFIED / DISABLED (spec §8).
TESTED = covered by an automated test in `test/` that passes with `npm test`.

**P1 control plane: IMPLEMENTED + TESTED (local) — NOT E2E_VERIFIED.** QA accepted CO-P1-001
on 2026-10-04 (local only; no remote, CI or PR yet — repo creation is OWNER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED).

| # | Capability | Status | Where | Proof |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scaffold: state.json, event intake, processed_events.json, audit JSONL, approvals/ | TESTED | `src/store.js`, `data/` | all tests run on a fresh scaffold |
| 2 | State machine, only legal transitions; illegal rejected + logged | TESTED | `src/states.js` | `state machine: illegal transition…` |
| 3 | Envelope validation, fail closed → BLOCKED / NEEDS_HUMAN | TESTED | `src/events.js` | `fail closed: event missing "<field>"` ×11, unparseable, wrong project/type |
| 4 | Idempotency (`processed_events.json`) | TESTED | `src/controlPlane.js` | `idempotency: …` ×2 |
| 5 | Single-writer: lease file + optimistic version lock | TESTED | `src/store.js` | `single-writer: …` ×3 (incl. 6 real OS processes racing) |
| 6 | Circuit breaker (N=3) → BLOCKED + escalation record | TESTED | `src/controlPlane.js` | `circuit breaker: …` ×2 |
| 7 | Approval gate stops + resumes; denied → BLOCKED | TESTED | `src/controlPlane.js`, `src/policy.js` | `approval gate: …` ×2 |
| 8 | Simulated planner + worker (deterministic, offline) | TESTED | `src/sim/` | used by every control-plane test |
| 9 | Happy path: 2 tasks → COMPLETE, exact-SHA verified, no human "continue" | TESTED | `src/controlPlane.js` | `happy path: …`, `exact-SHA: …` ×2 |
| 10 | Audit log: every transition (event_id, task_id, actor, from→to, ts) | TESTED | `src/store.js` | `audit: …`; samples in `docs/evidence/` |
| 11 | Offline / zero cost / no secrets | TESTED | — | `offline: …` static guard on `src/` |
| — | Untrusted payload / handoff cannot alter control logic | TESTED | `src/events.js`, `src/policy.js` | `untrusted: …` ×2 |
| — | Watchdog / reconciliation against real git + CI (spec §4.10) | PLANNED | — | P2 |
| — | GitHub Actions `concurrency` + blob-SHA commits (spec §4.7) | PLANNED | — | P2 (P1 uses local lease file + version) |
| — | Real agents (OpenAI planner, Claude worker) | PLANNED | — | P3, needs Product Owner approval + spend cap |

Nothing is E2E_VERIFIED yet: P1 runs only locally against simulated workers.

## Known limitations (P1)

- `state.lock` + `version` is a local stand-in for the GitHub-native lock (Actions `concurrency`
  + blob-SHA push) planned for P2.
- `processed_events.json` is written right after `state.json` under the same lease. A crash between
  the two can let an event be re-read; it is then stale (no longer the current task) and ignored.
- The sim worker keeps its attempt counter in memory. Across separate CLI invocations a retried
  task re-emits the same `event_id`, which is (correctly) treated as a duplicate, so the loop waits
  instead of progressing. Fail-safe, sim-only; the real worker in P3 produces unique event ids.
- Only `task.completed` drives transitions in P1; other valid event types are logged and ignored.
